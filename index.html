                <p>
                    I first saw Anchu in the snow frezing morning of November 2022 when we started our Spiti Trip where I was with me friends and she was on a solo trip. She talking to me for the first time was
                    her asking a favour to help her take something out from her bag that was secured on top of the bus and instantly she remebering that she needed it back typical cute anchu. We travelled to Sarhan where she was the only one who thought punjabi music was the best to vibe with unlike the rest, we danced, sang had fun, everything pretty normal right yeah wait for it!. Next day started with a temple visit where we all decided to go together instead this girl decided to ditch us ! just cause we were 5 mins late. Now she was on my list, I was just finding to roast her just in a fun banter way.
                    Then we started our way back to chitkul where she experienced her first snow, haha where she could not distinguish between a horse and a donkey when i made a joke on her which I can't tell else she'll kill me. 
                    That night we did stargazing which was magical, we talked and somehow there was a lot of similarities between us. we both felt something unusual connection atleast I did.
                    It all started when we went to play in the snow next morning where guju gang (travelling in our group, which had another yash hitting on her!) started throwing snow balls on her and burring her in snow even though she resisted. Yeah you guessed it right this is when I enter and started bullying them all with my friends burried them all in snow until they begged me to stop. BANG BANG haha typical Bollywood hero entry I know.
                    Anyhow everything sorted out we all came back and anchu got sick from the snow.She was there sitting out holding her head and dropping tears . I saw her and tried consoling her , I thought she is alone on a trip and now she is sick too. Our next stop was main tabo market, we reached there she was still feeling sick and sat alone in the bus , ofcourse how could let her be alone i also skipped the market and sat with her in the bus so that she doesn't feel that she is alone . She noticed all this and I thought she is sleeping so when other came back i asked them to be quiet so that she could sleep. I was feeling bad for her, i wanted her to be okay beacuse she had a bubbly happy vibe and the trip was starting to be boring now . I saw myself and how i would like a friend to be there for me and take care of me if i was in her place.
                    She was sleeping and we all know how hard it is to sleep in a bus , i was hesisting to offer her to sleep on my shoulder when she asked me the same! I mean a sec ago was thinking the same.
                    So me being super happy said yes please be comfortable,we felt a connection and she being safe around me made me feel good.
                    Anchu took a long nap my arm was numb but i didn't wanted to wake her up and then she woke up. We started talking about our personal lives. We had tons of similiarities, our stories , experiences were same , we bonded real good.
                    Then we came back to our stay for the day KAZA , I started feeling something for her and i was confused and sure at the same time i never felt something like this before . 
                    My friends hyped me up that i am in love ,typical men friendship.
                    Next day i thought let me give it a try so i staretd flirting with anchu , she being a cold hearted bitch started ignoring me which later other group friends were saying that she was also giving hints(absolutely were not hints) , so coming back i felt like i was only intrested and after trying for the whole day gave up and came back angry in my room and slept while everyone was still having fun.
                    Then i see her in my room with my friends and asking to play ludo! i thought of keeping my leftover dignity and respectfully declined haha. She and my friends then started forcing and asking me to play to i joined we had fun and vibed on another level. So i thought we can be friends of not lovers ;).
                    But destiny had something else planned , next morning i woke up wore a pure black outfit with a red jacket came out and thought to soak some sunshine. Then i see someone coming from behind i look back and you wont believe it was anchu with exact same outfit.Whatttttttt yes i know and love song started playing in the background !
                    We were going to visit world's highest post office and asia highest bridge (Chicham bridge).
                    We both started feeling that destiny has some other plans.We visted post office posted our postcards were i took her sign on my postcard.I got late and the bus already left (they were pranking me and my friend) Anchu started showing concern for me and others started teasing her and i thought her doing that was soo cute. Then we stopped at a monestry and took our lunch were everyone was rushing and not letting her eat saying that we'll be late so she had an argument and I also argued from her side , i don't usually jump into others fights but somehow i wanted to this time.
                    On our way back from chicham bridge i got sick now to barter anchu came to my seat and asked me if i needed to sleep ? I was feeling sick so i slept on her lap , somehow i was not able to sleep and we started talking and i dont how we both felt immense love for each other and we kissed right there ! The best kiss i ever had , we didn't even say anything , i looked in her eyes and without any exchange of words we knew what each other was feeling ! And thats when this amazing journey started.
                    And the rest is history :)
