                <p>
                    
                    I first saw Anchu on the freezing morning of November 2022 when we started our Spiti Trip. I was with my friends, and she was on a solo trip. Her first interaction with me was when she asked a favor to help her take something out from her bag that was secured on top of the bus. Instantly, she remembered that she needed it back—typical cute Anchu. We traveled to Sarhan, where she was the only one who thought Punjabi music was the best to vibe with, unlike the rest of us. We danced, sang, and had fun—everything pretty normal, right? Yeah, wait for it!
                    
                    The next day started with a temple visit where we all decided to go together, but this girl decided to ditch us just because we were 5 minutes late. Now she was on my list, and I was just finding ways to roast her in a fun banter way.
                    
                    Then we started our way back to Chitkul where she experienced her first snow. Haha, she could not distinguish between a horse and a donkey when I made a joke on her, which I can't tell, else she'll kill me.
                    
                    That night, we did stargazing, which was magical. We talked, and somehow, there were a lot of similarities between us. We both felt an unusual connection, at least I did.
                    
                    It all started when we went to play in the snow the next morning. The "Guju gang" (traveling in our group, which had another guy named Yash hitting on her) started throwing snowballs at her and burying her in snow, even though she resisted. Yeah, you guessed it right—this is when I entered and started bullying them all with my friends, burying them all in snow until they begged me to stop. Bang! Bang! Haha, typical Bollywood hero entry, I know.
                    
                    Anyhow, everything sorted out, and we all came back, but Anchu got sick from the snow. She was there, sitting out, holding her head and dropping tears. I saw her and tried consoling her. I thought she is alone on a trip, and now she is sick too. Our next stop was the main Tabo market. We reached there, she was still feeling sick, and sat alone on the bus. Of course, I couldn't let her be alone. I also skipped the market and sat with her on the bus so that she didn't feel that she was alone. She noticed all this, and I thought she was sleeping, so when others came back, I asked them to be quiet so that she could sleep. I was feeling bad for her. I wanted her to be okay because she had a bubbly, happy vibe, and the trip was starting to get boring now. I saw myself and how I would like a friend to be there for me and take care of me if I were in her place.
                    
                    She was sleeping, and we all know how hard it is to sleep on a bus. I was hesitating to offer her to sleep on my shoulder when she asked me the same! I mean, a second ago, I was thinking the same.
                    
                    So, me being super happy, said, "Yes, please be comfortable." We felt a connection, and her being safe around me made me feel good.
                    
                    Anchu took a long nap. My arm was numb, but I didn't want to wake her up. And then she woke up. We started talking about our personal lives. We had tons of similarities; our stories and experiences were the same. We bonded really well.
                    
                    Then we came back to our stay for the day, KAZA. I started feeling something for her, and I was confused and sure at the same time. I had never felt something like this before. My friends hyped me up that I am in love—typical men friendship.
                    
                    The next day, I thought let me give it a try. So, I started flirting with Anchu. She, being a cold-hearted person, started ignoring me, which later other group friends were saying that she was also giving hints (which absolutely were not hints). So, coming back, I felt like I was the only one interested, and after trying for the whole day, I gave up and came back angry to my room and slept while everyone was still having fun.
                    
                    Then I see her in my room with my friends, asking to play Ludo! I thought of keeping my leftover dignity and respectfully declined. Haha. She and my friends then started forcing and asking me to play, so I joined. We had fun and vibed on another level. So, I thought we can be friends if not lovers ;).
                    
                    But destiny had something else planned. The next morning, I woke up, wore a pure black outfit with a red jacket, came out, and thought to soak some sunshine. Then I see someone coming from behind. I look back, and you won't believe it was Anchu with the exact same outfit. What! Yes, I know, and a love song started playing in the background!
                    
                    We were going to visit the world's highest post office and Asia's highest bridge (Chicham bridge).
                    
                    We both started feeling that destiny has some other plans. We visited the post office, posted our postcards where I took her sign on my postcard. I got late, and the bus already left (they were pranking me and my friend). Anchu started showing concern for me, and others started teasing her. I thought her doing that was so cute. Then we stopped at a monastery and had our lunch, where everyone was rushing and not letting her eat, saying that we'll be late. So, she had an argument, and I also argued from her side. I don't usually jump into others' fights, but somehow I wanted to this time.
                    
                    On our way back from the Chicham bridge, I got sick. Now, to barter, Anchu came to my seat and asked me if I needed to sleep. I was feeling sick, so I slept on her lap. Somehow, I was not able to sleep, and we started talking. I don't know how, but we both felt immense love for each other, and we kissed right there! The best kiss I ever had. We didn't even say anything. I looked into her eyes, and without any exchange of words, we knew what each other was feeling! And that's when this amazing journey started.
                    
                    And the rest is history.:)
